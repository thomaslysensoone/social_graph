- First, we will first give you some sentiment grades of each genre of movie.
- Then, we will create a word cloud to provide the most comon word that you can find for each movie genre.

### sentiment grades

In our dataset conatining 4 800 movies, we will extract a sentiment grade for each genre of movie. We have 20 unique movie genres which are 'Action', 'Science-Fiction','Romance','Wester','TV movies and so on. 
Based on the LabMT wordlist dataset we will give a sentiment grade of each movie genre. The more the grade is high the more the sentiment is positive. 
The list consists of 10222 words with their average happiness score obtained using Amazon's Mechanical Turk which is a crowdsourcing internet marketplace. The word list was created by using four sources of text; Twitter, Google Books, Music lyrics from 1960 to 2007 and the New York times from 1987 to 2007. The authors then asked the users of Mechanical Turk to rate each word on a nine point interger scale and from this they obtained 50 independent evaluations per word.

Now that we have the sentiment grade over the genre, you can have an idea about the feeling that a typeof movie will bring to you
